Configuring the EC2E AMI:

On the EC2 AMI the ec2-enhanced RPM, which depends upon condor, will need
to be installed.  This RPM will install the caroniad daemon and configure
condor to use job hooks and run the caroniad daemon.  The job-hooks will
also need to be configured to communicate with the caroniad daemon.

An RSA private key needs to be stored in '/root/.ec2/rsa_key" on the AMI.
This key must be able to decrypt data encrypted with the RSA public key
provided in a route's configuration (set_rsapublickey) or in the
job's submit file (+RSAPublicKey).

Next the caroniad daemon must be configured.  The caroniad daemon will
first look for its configuration in condor's configuration files.  The
following parameters can be placed in a condor configuration file to
configure caroniad:

EC2E_DAEMON:
   Type: String
   Desc: The caroniad binary with full path

EC2E_DAEMON_LOG:
   Type: String
   Desc: The location of the log file for the caroniad to use for logging

MAX_EC2E_DAEMON_LOG:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: The maximum size of the log file before it will be rotated

EC2E_DAEMON_IP:
   Type: IP Address
   Desc: The IP address of the interface caroniad use for connections

EC2E_DAEMON_PORT:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: The port caroniad should use to listen for connections

EC2E_DAEMON_QUEUED_CONNECTIONS:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: The number of allowed outstanding connections

EC2E_DAEMON_LEASE_TIME:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: The maximum amount of time a job is allowed to run without providing
         an update

EC2E_DAEMON_LEASE_CHECK_INTERVAL:
   Type: Integer
   Desc: How often to check for lease expiration

If the configuration is not found in condor's configuration files, then
caroniad will look in /etc/condor/caroniad.conf.

Then edit the job hook configuration file to communicate with caroniad.
See /usr/share/doc/condor-job-hooks-1.0/INSTALL for details.

Once the configuration is complete, restart condor.
